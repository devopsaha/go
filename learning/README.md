# go learning

Why go, because its the language of the tools devops engineers use.  It's a good choice for tooling, and backend engineering need the features that go was designed around.

There are numerous resources out there to learn go, why go, how to write good go code.  This however is not about adding another collection of lists to that pool of go resources, those exist and we recommend you find the ones that work for you.  This section is how we learn by doing go.  Good, bad, and just plain scary.  We learn through failure, embrace it, publicly in this repo.  Resources or sources of inspiration will be added to each section so those authors can be recognized.  Time to get started.
